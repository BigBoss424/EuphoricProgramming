I utilized the [Garth](https://garth.darn.es/) theme from the [repository](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth). The developer made it really easy to utilize his theme as a template for me to start a generalized development blog.

Go visit his [repository](https://github.com/daviddarnes/garth) to learn how you can utilize it. I will be documenting my progress with this blog.
